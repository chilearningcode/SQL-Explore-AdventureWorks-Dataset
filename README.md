## III. Eploring the Dataset
### Apply Problem Solving 

| Understand Problem | Break it down into smaller pieces | Ideate | Implement and Review 
|-|-|-|-
| Which to be calculated (sum, count, ratio, etc.) and grouped? <br> Does it needs any filter (time, conditions, etc.)? | Which tables have data that I want to get? <br> Which columns have data corresponded to the problem? <br> Can I get the data I by one step, if not, break down even smaller? | How many step did I need to get the final result? <br> Is it optimized? |
