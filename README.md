## 📌 Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? 
 
> This project utilizes advanced SQL techniques to analyze the AdventureWorks dataset, revealing trends, enhancing data visualization, and supporting decision-making within a business environment.  

### 👤 Who is this project for?  


➡️ **Sales manager** who want to understand the Sales revenue components and Sales trend. 

###  ❓Business Questions:  

- Analyze data on items, sales, order quantities, growth rates, top categories, top territories, and total discount costs by subcategories.
- Assess customer retention rates, stock level trends, month-over-month differences, and stock-to-sales ratios.
- Evaluate the number and value of pending orders in 2014.

### 🎯Project Outcome:  

- **Sales and Growth Trends**: Bike Racks and Road Frames achieved the highest sales revenue and quantity, respectively. Mountain Frames and Socks showed notable year-over-year growth.
- **Discounts and Customer Retention**: Helmets had continuous discount promotions with increased discount costs from 2012 to 2013, while customer retention dropped significantly after the first purchase, indicating the need for better retention strategies.

## III. Eploring the Dataset
### Apply Problem Solving 

| Understand Problem | Break it down into smaller pieces | Ideate | Implement and Review 
|-|-|-|-
| Which to be calculated (sum, count, ratio, etc.) and grouped? <br> Does it needs any filter (time, conditions, etc.)? | Which tables have data that I want to get? <br> Which columns have data corresponded to the problem? <br> Can I get the data I by one step, if not, break down even smaller? | How many step did I need to get the final result? <br> Is it optimized? | 

### Implement Step 
#### Query 01: Calc Quantity of items, Sales value & Order quantity by each Subcategory in Last 12 Mth
```sql
SELECT 
  format_datetime('%b %Y', sod.ModifiedDate) as period
  ,pps.Name as name
  ,sum(sod.OrderQty) as qty_item
  ,round(sum(sod.LineTotal),2) as total_sales
  ,count(distinct sod.SalesOrderID) as order_cnt
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` as sod
left join `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as pp 
  on sod.ProductID = pp.ProductID
left join `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` as pps 
  on cast(pp.ProductSubcategoryID as int) = pps.ProductSubcategoryID
where date(sod.ModifiedDate) >= (select date_add(max(date(ModifiedDate)), interval -12 month)
                             from `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail`)
group by 1,2
order by 2,1 desc;
```
|Row	|period|name|qty_item|total_sales|order_cnt|
|---|---|---|---|---|---

  ),
  sale_diff as (
    select *
      ,lag(qty_item) over (partition by name order by year) as prv_qty
      ,round((qty_item - lag(qty_item) over (partition by name order by year))/(lag(qty_item) over (partition by name order by year)),2) as qty_diff
    from qty_data 
  ),
  sale_rk as (
    select *
      ,dense_rank() over (order by qty_diff desc) as dkr 
    from sale_diff 
  )
select distinct 
  name
  ,qty_item 
  ,prv_qty
  ,qty_diff
  ,dkr 
from sale_rk 
where dkr <= 3 
order by dkr;
```
|Row	|name|qty_item|prv_qty|qty_diff|dkr
|---|---|---|---|---|---
|1	|Mountain Frames|3168|510|5.21|1
|2	|Socks|2724|523|4.21|2
|3	|Road Frames|5564|1137|3.89|3

Road Frames had the highest quantity sales, while Mountain Frames and Socks showed the highest _year-over-year_ growth rates.

#### Query 03: Query 3: Ranking Top 3 TeritoryID with biggest Order quantity of every year. If there's TerritoryID with same quantity in a year, do not skip the rank number
```sql
with 
  data as (
    select 
      format_date("%Y", sod.ModifiedDate) as year 
      ,soh.TerritoryID

    from `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` as sod
    left join `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` as soh on sod.SalesOrderID = soh.SalesOrderID
    group by 1,2 
    order by 1 desc 
  ),
  ranking as (
    select *
      ,dense_rank() over (partition by year order by order_cnt desc) as rk
    from data 
    order by 1 desc 
  )
select *

with discount_data as (
  select distinct 
    sod.ModifiedDate 
    ,ps.Name 
    ,so.Type
    ,so.DiscountPct*sod.UnitPrice*sod.OrderQty as dis_cost 
  from `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` as sod
  left join `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as p  on sod.ProductID = p.ProductID
  left join `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` as ps on cast(p.ProductSubcategoryID as int) = ps.ProductSubcategoryID

|Row	|year|Name|total_cost
|-|-|-|-
|1	|2012|Helmets|149.71669
|2	|2013|Helmets|543.21975

The "Helmets" sub-category was the only one with discount promotions in both 2012 and 2013. <br> 
There was a significant increase in discount costs from 2012 to 2013, suggesting a more aggressive discount strategy or higher sales volumes benefiting from seasonal discounts.

#### Query 05: Query 5: Retention rate of Customer in 2014 with status of Successfully Shipped (Cohort Analysis)
```sql
with 
  info as (
    select 
      extract(year from ModifiedDate) as yr

|7	|BB Ball Bearing|6|2011|5259|null|0.0
|8	|...

Over the last 6 months of the year, the data shows fluctuations and variations in stock quantity for each product. There is a consistent decrease each quarter, suggesting that **the products were selling well and steadily**.

#### Query 07: Calc Ratio of Stock / Sales in 2011 by product name, by month *Order results by month desc, ratio desc. Round Ratio to 1 decimal mom yoy*
```sql
with sale_data as (
  select 
    extract(month from sod.ModifiedDate) as mth 
    ,extract(year from sod.ModifiedDate) as yr 
    ,sod.ProductID
    ,p.Name

  from `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` as sod
  left join `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as p 
    on sod.ProductID = p.ProductID
  where format_date("%Y", sod.ModifiedDate) = '2011'
  group by 1,2,3,4
),
stock_data as ( 
  select
    extract(month from ModifiedDate) as mth 
    ,extract(year from ModifiedDate) as yr 
    ,ProductID
    ,sum(StockedQty) as stocks
  from `adventureworks2019.Production.WorkOrder` 
  where format_date("%Y", ModifiedDate) = '2011'
  group by 1,2,3 
)
select 
  a.*
  ,b.stocks 
  ,round(coalesce(b.stocks,0)/a.sales,2) as ratio 
from sale_data as a 
left join stock_data as b 
  on a.ProductID = b.ProductID 
  and a.mth = b.mth

|7	|12|2011|761|Road-650 Red, 62|62|465|7.5
|8	|...

Higher sales and a lower stock-to-sales ratio over the months indicate that the products were performing well in the market. This suggests strong demand and efficient inventory management.

#### Query 08: No of order and value at Pending status in 2014
```sql
select 
  extract(year from ModifiedDate) as yr
  ,Status
  ,count(PurchaseOrderID) as order_cnt
  ,sum(TotalDue) as value 
from `adventureworks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader` 
where format_timestamp('%Y', ModifiedDate) = '2014'
  and Status = 1
group by 1,2;
```
|Row	|yr|Status|order_cnt|value
|-|-|-|-|-
|1	|2014|1|224|3873579.0123000029

The high number of pending orders highlights the need to **revamp the order process**. Doing so can help reduce pending orders and drive higher sales revenue.

## IV. Conclusion 
This SQL project delved into the AdventureWorks dataset, revealing key insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance. The analysis highlights the power of data-driven strategies in optimizing business operations and making informed decisions.
