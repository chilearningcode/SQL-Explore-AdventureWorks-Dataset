## üìå Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### üìñ What is this project about? 
 
> This project utilizes advanced SQL techniques to analyze the AdventureWorks dataset, revealing trends, enhancing data visualization, and supporting decision-making within a business environment.  

### üë§ Who is this project for?  


‚û°Ô∏è **Sales manager** who want to understand the Sales revenue components and Sales trend. 

###  ‚ùìBusiness Questions:  

- Analyze data on items, sales, order quantities, growth rates, top categories, top territories, and total discount costs by subcategories.
- Assess customer retention rates, stock level trends, month-over-month differences, and stock-to-sales ratios.
- Evaluate the number and value of pending orders in 2014.

### üéØProject Outcome:  

- **Sales and Growth Trends**: Bike Racks and Road Frames achieved the highest sales revenue and quantity, respectively. Mountain Frames and Socks showed notable year-over-year growth.
- **Discounts and Customer Retention**: Helmets had continuous discount promotions with increased discount costs from 2012 to 2013, while customer retention dropped significantly after the first purchase, indicating the need for better retention strategies.
- **Stock and Order Management**: Quarterly stock levels consistently declined, indicating robust sales. A substantial number of pending orders highlight the need to assess vendor performance for efficiency and suggest improvements to their order processes.
